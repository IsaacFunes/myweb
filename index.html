				<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
					
				<p>I'm a programmer on the week days, a team leader on the weekends and an
				optimistic person regardless on what day. Writing and music is a passion and 
                programming	is a future goal. You'll usually catch me on my Mac writing a script on
				my next upcoming project or writing down lyrics. I also love to direct, edit and basically any
				thing that has to do with film. I've gained a vast knowledge throughout my life and 
				plan to put it to use. I also love cinema, novels and Starbucks. My favorite brand is Apple
				and I'll rock a pair of Converse. Thank you for being here.</p>
