				<h1>AMERICAN HISTORY X </h1>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Director: Tony Kaye</li>
					<li>Writer: David McKenna</li>
				</ul>
				
				<br>
				<p>“A film that is a derivative of crass subject matter that blends in a reality of truth and the hardships 
				    of the human race, how much change can change one person to reach solitude.”

                    American History X reigns over many films in my mind. On one hand, 
					it is heartbreaking to watch the piece and on the other, it is a finely executed screenplay that Tony Kaye 
					crafts perfectly. The film holds no punches as it shows the raw world the characters are living in. Poverty 
					and a corrupt world don’t just excavate because of a certain race or nationality, everyone feels it and deals 
					with it. A once soderinized man (Edward Norton) that ruled a gang syndicate gets his comeuppance when he lives a 
					brutal reality in prison leaving a brainwashed Neo-nazi sibling (Edward Furlong) to follow his brother’s footsteps, 
					also dealing with personal issues including his ailing mother (Beverly D’ Angelo). Norton’s character gets released 
					from his bindings and his return home ultimately binds him to his old ways. Prison changes his perspective and he 
					converts to a new world where he realizes violence and race differentials are at stake. He is put in a crossfire by trying 
					to convince his brother to follow his actions and deal with his status which he tries to recluse. Inadequately, his life 
					is shown in memories that explore his mind, feelings toward race, and his reliance on violence. You want to see Furlong 
					change his cruel ways and you cling to hope for desperation for him. He desperately needs his brother's unexpected change to 
					live in reality. Race wars, violence, and gargantuan motives don’t give you power, perhaps in a fictional world, but this film 
					blends in the harsh cold reality. These certain attributes don’t define you as a person but merely weaken you as a whole. 
					However, in reality, not everyone sees eye to eye on a level where peace and tranquillity have identical seclusion. 
					The color of skin or the use of a derogatory term triggers certain characters to inflict certain actions upon 
					the characters and it is painstaking to watch. The ending is heartbreaking because it reminds the viewer of the way the world actually is 
					and it doesn’t always end on a merry conclusion. Edward Norton carries the film by playing the titular Derek Vinyard, but he also gives a 
					gripping performance and expertly spews out verbal dialogue that is both shocking and impacting.
                    The film explores many themes and one main one being, does racial inclusion and violence really define power? The answer 
					is vague but quite simple, after the watch really think of this fictional movie world and try to mark a parallel to your 
					actual world and the reality you see, the mark shouldn’t be sheer because the film is the history of the current world at 
					its finest and its most treacherous. American History X is the philosophy of hate and violence begets violence. 
					The whole film is a series of escalations based on revenge; family might be lost and blood might be spilled, 
					so this corruption leads to destruction but is it too late to change? A definite recommendation!
                    8/10</p>

				<h1>ANOMALISA </h1>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Director: Charlie Kauffman</li>
					<li>Writer: Charlie Kauffman</li>
				</ul>
				
				<br>
				<p>"Diverse in it's creative ploy and its melodramatic themes, Anomalisa is a gem for film watchers who enjoy
					the quaint expressive writings of Charlie Kauffman and admirers for life". 
					The film might appear to be a persona of emotions involving sculpted figurines but the story is so much more. When a human
					loses human compassion and the environment becomes dull, what is life without a colorless hue? The question stampedes from
					the main character who is essentially spiraling into a midlife crisis. Though success is imminent, the success does not grasp the
					fluctuation of the character's life. Emptiness has truly grabbed hold of his inner being, he can barely form sexual intimacy because 
					he is a shell of his former self. A former successful writer lives his days as dull as you can make them. He can't even distinguish
					between alternating faces and voices and everything is identical. An anomaly appears as you see this man's social fears and anxieties 
					bottle up inside. His breaking point is his silence, he just allows things to happen with no immediate say and things go accordingly to the 
					way they appear to happen, there is no alternative. Suddenly, a woman Lisa, appears which grabs the man eye and his love for human intimacy 
					comes to volition as he finally sees someone else different. His mundane life consisting of his fame, wife and his child, seem fruitless when 
					his real love comes from a woman who has a distinct voice and a distinct personality. To the audience, Lisa seems like a well maintained everyday 
					person but to author Michael, this woman is a symbol to his once chosen life where everything did not feel black and white. Anomaly presents itself, 
					as you wonder, has this man created this form in his mind to cope with loneliness or is Lisa really a true being that tears into his heart. 
					The answer is up for interpretation as many incidents in his life seem sudden and unexpected, the kind of excitement a dull life would need.
					The art direction and the amount of detail in this film is unremarkable. The story speaks volumes about the human mind and the 
					typical life of someone we should assume who should be happy because of fame. The direction is heart jerking, as you cling for desperation for 
					this man's heart. The emotion comes from his conclusion, and you ponder in your mind when the credits roll, what is the distinction between 
					reality and fiction, and how broken someone could become. The truth is no farther less than the speculations you will have, there is no real 
					meaning in the end of the film, a perspective, albeit, there is no finalization and meaning in physical life. You just make things happen, 
					the film captures life that is null as you perceive it.
					9/10</p>
